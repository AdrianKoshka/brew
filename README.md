# Brew

A fork of vanilla, a theme provided with [malt](https://github.com/dmulholland/malt).

Just like vanilla, this theme does not support blog-style index pages.

## Include Files

This theme supports the following include files:

* `menu`

  This file should contain a list of links.

## Changes

- Use [Fira Sans](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira) as the default font-family.
  - Link to Mozilla's Fira stylesheet in `base.ibis`.
- Change some colours around to fit in with AlcDocs colours more.
